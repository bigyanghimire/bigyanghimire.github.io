# Journey on my new venture

I am going to be documenting my journey. Maybe I should have done it for my first startup as well before it failed. This time though I am going to be writing 4 times a month. 

I don't expect many people to read this, but those who do, I am very thankful for.

I have an idea.
 
Custom starmaps printed and delivered to people who order. This is a huge jump from my former SaaS product. The major difference is my market. I am developing a B2C product now. 

After scouraging Hackernews for a year and every startup forums, I've been enlightended that B2C is a hard market. Mainly because consumers don't pay as much as businesses do. $5/mo is very high pricing for a consumer. Businesses don't buy a product for $5/mo unless it's per user.

There lies the big difference. If i develop a B2B app, I am never gonnna price it lower than $40/mo. That's the promise I've made. If it's not worth $40/mo I'll add features so that it validates for $40/mo. To get to $500/mo I need 13 customers. 13 customers is peanuts for big companies. So, B2B scales really well.
